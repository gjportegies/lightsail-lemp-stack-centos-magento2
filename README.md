# Lightsail LEMP Stack deployment on Centos

This deploy script is currently used by our Magento agency to deploy a LEMP stack on Lightsail server spinup. 
This is specially handy to quickly deploy and setup a single Magento 2 on a micro instance for development purposes. 

You can just clone this repo on your machine and run the .sh script, or copy-paste it in Lightsail pre-deployment shell script box in order to execute it on instance deployment.

TODO: Command details will be added here to make this readme a proper documentation reference.
